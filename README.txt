This repository contains 2 main components:

RDE-Visualization-Website
This repository contains code and other assets to render a website displaying prototype visualizations of selected data sets in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)'s Research Data Environment (RDE). These visualizations are designed to give researchers and data aficionados ideas for projects using the data on the RDE; they also strive to provide concrete examples of how large, complex data sets can be distilled into useful products.

RDE-Visualization-Support
Support scripts for the RDE Visualization Website. This repository contains all scripts and data (or instructions to download the data) used to generate the final data files for each visualization.

Refer to "README.md" in each component's folder for more details.
